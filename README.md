Project Description

TotoRun is a fun and interactive website where you can customize your own tortoise—name, age, shell size, race terrain, even upload a glamour photo—and challenge an overconfident rabbit in a virtual race. Your goal? Find the legendary combo to finally embarrass “Mr. Show-Off Rabbit.”

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

The world has never given tortoises the chance to prepare strategically before racing a rabbit. This is a serious oversight in animal sports entertainment.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We created an epic, cinematic, and completely unnecessary race customization platform where tortoises can fine-tune their racing stats, pick exotic terrains, and take on the rabbit in style.
